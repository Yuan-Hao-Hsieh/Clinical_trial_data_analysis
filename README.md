**Real-World Data / Real-World Evidence Statistical Investigation**

This repository contains the project report for the 113 Academic Year Special Report Competition by the Department of Statistics at National Taipei University. Our study explores the application of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) in medical and public health research.

---

## Overview

**Real-World Data (RWD):**  
Data collected from everyday clinical practice—such as electronic health records, insurance claims, patient registries, and health surveys—which reflects actual patient experiences.

**Real-World Evidence (RWE):**  
Evidence derived from the analysis of RWD. It is used to assess medical interventions’ effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness, and to support regulatory decision-making.

In our study, we:
- Describe and process RWD from a prospective study and a Phase 2 clinical trial of LBS-008 (a drug for Stargardt Disease).
- Employ various statistical techniques, including descriptive statistics, regression analysis, ANOVA, and linear mixed models (LMM), to analyze the data.
- Discuss model fitting, hypothesis testing, and the interpretation of results in the context of clinical decision-making.
